# Secure Information Transfer Examples

This project provides JavaScript implementations of two common cryptographic techniques for secure information transfer: Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA encryption. These scripts demonstrate how these methods can be easily implemented.

## Scripts

### `Diffie–Hellman.js`

This script demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. This shared secret can then be used for symmetric encryption.

**How to run:**

```bash
node Diffie–Hellman.js
```

### `RSA_encryption.js`

This script implements RSA encryption. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This allows anyone to encrypt a message using the public key, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt it.

**How to run:**

```bash
node RSA_encryption.js
```
